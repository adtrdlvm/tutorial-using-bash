Tutorial on using the bash shell.

This tutorial covers:

    The Interactive Shell
    Basic File Management
    Regular Expressions
    Processes
    Shell programming
    Working with documents 

You can create the html via Pandoc (see Section 6 of bash.md) or R Markdown processing. The version in this repository was created via

```
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit2html('bash.Rmd')"
```

Note that processing in that way causes bash.md to be overwritten.
